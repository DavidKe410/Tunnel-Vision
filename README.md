# Tunnel-Vision
Rapid mapping and state estimation through a fixed-wing UAS in a GPS-denied and featureless environment.


Acronyms:
- FV: Flight Vehicle
- CAD: Computer Aided Design
- UAS: Unmanned aerial system
- GPS: Global Positioning System

TODO:
1. Create the structure around FV components
2. Test components and create calibration or initial setup procedures?

Notes:
1. Finished CADing potential FV control parts and layed most of them out in a possible configuration
2. Finished initial calcuations for baseline wing area and lift aerodynamics based on 4412 airfoil
